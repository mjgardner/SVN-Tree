=head1 NAME

SVN::Tree - SVN::Fs + Tree::Path::Class

=head1 VERSION

version 0.004

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use SVN::Tree;
    use SVN::Core;
    use SVN::Repos;
    use SVN::Fs;

    my $repos = SVN::Repos::open('/path/to/repository');
    my $fs = $repos->fs;

    my $tree = SVN::Tree->new(root => $fs->revision_root($fs->youngest_rev));
    print map {$_->path->stringify} $tree->tree->traverse;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module marries L<Tree::Path::Class|Tree::Path::Class> to the
L<Perl Subversion bindings|Alien::SVN>, enabling you to traverse the files and
directories of Subversion revisions and transactions, termed
L<roots|SVN::Fs/_p_svn_fs_root> in Subversion API parlance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 root

Required attribute referencing a L<_p_svn_fs_root|SVN::Fs/_p_svn_fs_root> object.

=head2 tree

Read-only accessor for the L<Tree::Path::Class|Tree::Path::Class> object
describing the filesystem hierarchy contained in the C<root>.  Will be updated
every time the C<root> attribute is changed.

=head2 projects

Read-only accessor returning an array reference containing one or more
L<Tree::Path::Class|Tree::Path::Class> hierarchies for the top-level project
directories in the repository.  In the case of a repository with F<trunk>,
F<branches> and F<tags> at the top level, this will be one element referring
to the same hierarchy available through the C<tree> attribute.

Like C<tree> this will also be updated with C<root> changes.

=head2 branches

Read-only accessor returning a hash reference of arrays containing
L<Tree::Path::Class|Tree::Path::Class> objects for each branch in each project
in the repository.  The hash keys are the names of the projects, and F<trunk>
counts as a branch.

Like C<tree> this will also be updated with C<root> changes.

=head1 SEE ALSO

The distribution for this module also includes
L<MooseX::Types::SVN|MooseX::Types::SVN>, a
L<Moose type library|MooseX::Types> for the Subversion Perl bindings. This may
be split off into its own distribution at a later point if it proves useful in
other projects.
